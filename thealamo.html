		<p>The Alamo, is a historical landmark that the Battle of the Alamo took place from February 23, 1836 - March 6, 1836. This event was part of the Texas Revolution, and it was a war fought by Texans to gain independence from Mexico. During this war, hundreds of lives were lost on both sides. Since then, this massive gravesite has become one of the most haunted locations in San Antonio. <br><br>

		People have claimed they saw the army marching up and down in front of the Alamo, guards standing all night to protect the site, and people disappearing into the walls. In addition, the staff  who was patrolling during a late night shift saw dark figures roaming the corridors at night, and even heard distinct sounds of moaning. The ghostly activities became so active that the staff started to refuse working the late night shifts. <br><br>

		Long before the Alamo became a battleground, it was actually once a cemetery for the city of San Antonio. It was a cemetery from 1724  to 1793, for nearly 70 years. Thousands of bodies were placed to rest during this time. It is said that a little boy with blonde hair is often spotted at the upstairs left window of the Alamo, where it is now the current gift shop. The most frequent spotting of this little boy happens during the month of February. <br><br>

		Many unrested souls reside at the Alamo. If you’re brave enough, I encourage you to go visit the Alamo; pay your respects, learn, and experience the spookyness of it. It is a fantastic historic landmark that will forever make you remember the Alamo.
