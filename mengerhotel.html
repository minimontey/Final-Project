		The Menger Hotel first completed on February 1, 1859. The hotel was built by an architect named John M. Fries. The Menger Hotel gained its name from a German immigrant, William A. Menger. He arrived in San Antonio in the early 1840’s to find his “manifest destiny”. He started up his own brewery company called the Western Brewery. Which became not only a huge success, but the first brewery in Texas. <br><br>
			
		During this time, the Western Brewery was built on part of the site where the Battle of the Alamo took place. On the other side of the brewery was a boarding house that was run by a widow named Mary Guenther. Later, William A. Menger asked Mary Guenther to marry, and so they did. In addition to the Western Brewery, they ran the boardinghouse together which thrived in San Antonio. With their ever growing success, they needed to expand the boarding house. That is when Mr. and Mrs. Menger decided to build the hotel and name it after them. <br><br> 

		However once the Civil War hit, the business for the Mengers slowed dramatically. The hotel became a makeshift hospital for those who were sick and severely wounded. Many of them passed away, not being able to regain their health. A few years later, William A. Menger himself passed away due to unknown circumstances in March 1871. Despite William A. Menger’s death, Mary Menger brought their business back to life by refusing to give up. Within a year, she was able to welcome 2,000 guests to the hotel. From then on, the Menger Hotel regained their success. <br><br>

		Due to it’s past known histories and events at the hotel, it is said the Menger Hotel is extremely haunted. Guests have reported countless unexplainable paranormal activities such as faces appearing while looking at the mirror, beds levitating off the floor, hearing strange noises, smelling cigar smoke in non-smoking rooms, and heavy doors opening on its own. <br><br>

		Furthermore, people occasionally claim to see Teddy Roosevelt’s ghost in the Menger Bar. Teddy was a huge fan of the Menger Hotel ever since he visited the hotel with the Rough Riders in 1898. It is said that the spirits of the Rough Riders enjoys camping out at the Menger Hotel even after hundreds of years have passed. Staff at the Menger Hotel reports about a man appearing at the bar when closing up at night. This ghostly figure, most likely Teddy Roosevelt, either doesn’t move at all or hollers out at the employees. Nevertheless, instead of fearing Teddy, most staff do not fear him at all. <br><br>

		Sallie White is another spirit that resides at the Menger Hotel. She was a beloved staff member who worked at the hotel in the late nineteenth century. However, she was unfortunately murdered by her jealous husband. She was shot twice two-blocks away from the Menger Hotel while running away from him. She passed away two days later on the third floor of the hotel. Guests have reported seeing her carrying armful of towels or sheets to her chest. Some guests have even reported seeing her walk through doors and walls, and even seeing Sallie folding sheets at the edge of their bed. <br><br>

		Lastly, Captain Ricahrd King is a very known ghost at the Menger Hotel. He founded a steamboat company, and after visiting Texas, he opened King Ranch. When visiting San Antonio, he fell in love with the Menger Hotel that it became his go to staying place. Due to him staying so often, the Menger Hotel provided him with his own private suite on the second floor. At the end of his life when he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, he requested to be brought up to his private suite. In his private suite, he passed away on April 14, 1885. His funeral was held in the lobby of the Menger Hotel. <br><br>

		Today, the King Ranch Suite is open to be booked, and guests staying in the suite are sleeping in the same bed Captain King has passed in. Guests staying in the room have reported feeling constantly being watched, and even waking up to see Captain King at the foot of their bed.  <br><br>

		If you are looking for a ghostly stay, book a room at the Menger Hotel! If you’re brave enough, take that extra leap to book the King Ranch Suite to experience Captain King’s presence yourself!
