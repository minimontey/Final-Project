	  <h4>About Me</h4>
	  <p>Thank you for visiting All Things Spooky! My name is Maria and I love paranormal stories! Ever since I was in high school, I got intrigued by the world of paranormal from watching “Paranormal Story Time” videos on YouTube. With that, I started to wonder what paranormal stories my hometown had to offer. The city of San Antonio has tons of history to offer along with spooky ghost stories that will leave you with chills for days! </p>

	  <h4>Why I Started This Website</h4>
	  <p>I created All Things Spooky to not only tell spooky stories about San Antonio, but to educate others about the history as well. There are so many cool and interesting stories behind how a certain place became haunted, and I would like to share them with you! As I find more spooky stories in San Antonio, I am planning on updating this website. So stay tuned!  </p>
