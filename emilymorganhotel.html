			The Emily Morgan Hotel first opened in 1984. However, before it became a hotel, it was once a Medical Arts Building that operated for about 50 years. The Medical Arts Building became the first doctor’s building for the city of San Antonio in 1926. While it was a medical facility, the lower levels were used as doctors offices, top levels as hospitals and operation rooms, and the basement as the morgue room. In less than 10 years after the Medical Arts Building closed, it became the now known Emily Morgan Hotel. <br><br>

			Due to its past history, no wonder the Emily Morgan Hotel is claimed to be one of the most haunted hotels in San Antonio. According to people’s witnesses, the most haunted floors are the basement, 7th, 9th, and 14th floor. It is important to note that the Emily Morgan Hotel does not actually have 14 floors, and it is actually 13. It is suspected the hotel changed their flooring numbers due to the fact that the number 13 is associated with bad luck. It is said that if you’re looking into experiencing some ghostly activities, it is recommended to stay on the 7th floor.  <br><br>

			The floors mentioned above were used as a morgue, psychiatric ward, surgery level, and waiting area while it was still being operated as a Medical Arts Building. People report the ghostly activities that occur involve the spirits of those from the Medical Arts Building.  <br><br>

			The guests staying at the Emily Morgan Hotel have reported the 14th floor smelling like a hospital. In addition, people have experienced opening the doors to the hallway to see a hospital waiting room. However, once they closed the door and opened it again, the waiting room vanished.  <br><br>

			Furthermore, the elevator at the Emily Morgan Hotel operates in mysterious ways. It is well known at the hotel that the elevator moves up and down without a single person on it. If there are guests on the elevator, it will skip past the requested floors and take them to floors they never pressed the button to. Occasionally, the elevator even gets stuck and closed for hours, trapping the guests inside. To top it off, it is not uncommon for the elevator to take the guest all the way to the basement where the morgue used to be. <br><br>

			Lastly, the basement where it was once used as a morgue is known to have strange ghostly activities. The basement is blocked off from the general public who is not an employee of the hotel. Nonetheless, even the employees refuse to go down to the basement. The employees have reported seeing orbs, hearing voices, and the smelling of human bodies burning to be cremated. While it was a Medical Arts Building, hundreds of bodies were examined for autopsies and to be cremated. <br><br>

			If you are ever on a hunt for a paranormal place to stay in San Antonio, why not stay at the Emily Morgan Hotel? You will definitely enjoy your spooky stay!
